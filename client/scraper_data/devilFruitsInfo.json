If someone is caught by the swamp created by Caribou, they will sink more if they struggle. The swamp also serves as a storage space, allowing Caribou to store an infinite amount of whatever he has captured inside his body. The storage space can also be used to help carry a large surplus of food which remains edible over long periods of time, with Caribou noting that he has a month's worth of rations stored within himself. He is able to keep several weapons within himself and bring them out when he needs them. While he can keep creatures alive when they are in his swamp, he can also use the swamp to drown his opponents if he wishes to.",
