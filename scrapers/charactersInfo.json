Since their leader, Karoo, is the royal pet of the princess of Arabasta; Nefertari Vivi and has always lived and been by her side, it can be assumed that the other members are given similar, if not equal treatment, and live in the palace alongside Karoo. With the addition of Matsuge as a member, it can also be assumed that he has now been given this same treatment as well.",
